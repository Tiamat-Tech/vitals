Vitals lives in the menu bar, keeping track of resource usage in the background so you can summon it instantly at any time.

While other tools like Activity Monitor show you each process' _current_ CPU usage, Vitals shows a per-process CPU graph covering the last 60 seconds. This makes it much easier to track down apps that misbehave sporadically.

## Install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/hmarr/vitals/releases/latest), and move it to "/Applications". Right-click the app in Finder then select "Open" from the context menu.

## Usage

Vitals runs in the background, and lives in your Mac's menu bar. The icon looks like a little "V" in a circle. Click that to open Vitals. To quit, right-click the menu bar icon and select "Quit Vitals" from the menu that appears.
